# Data Cleaning & Analysis Exercises 📊

Welcome to my **Data Cleaning and Analysis** repository! This collection showcases hands-on exercises designed to transform raw, messy datasets into structured, meaningful information.  

Through these exercises, I explore key aspects of data preprocessing, including:

- Handling missing values  
- Correcting inconsistencies  
- Normalizing and structuring data  
- Preparing datasets for deeper analysis  

Using **Python** and powerful libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, each example demonstrates practical techniques for cleaning, aggregating, and visualizing data.  

The goal of this repository is to help learners:

- Practice technical data handling skills  
- Develop a strong analytical mindset  
- Learn best practices in data preprocessing  
- Gain confidence in extracting actionable insights from real-world datasets  

Whether you are a student, aspiring data analyst, or someone looking to refine your data skills, this repository provides clear, step-by-step exercises to grow your understanding and mastery of **data science fundamentals**.  

✨ Dive in, explore the exercises, and level up your data skills!
